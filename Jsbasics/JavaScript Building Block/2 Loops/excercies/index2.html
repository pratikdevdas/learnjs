      <!-- In this next task, we want you to write a simple program that, given a name, searches an array of objects containing names and phone numbers (phonebook) and, if it finds the name, outputs the name and phone number into the paragraph (para) and then exits the loop before it has run its course.

If you haven't read about objects yet, don't worry! For now, all you need to know is how to access a member-value pair. You can read up on objects in the JavaScript object basics tutorial.

You are given three variables to begin with:

name — contains a name to search for
para — contains a reference to a paragraph, which will be used to report the results
phonebook - contains the phonebook entries to search.
You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous task. -->
    <section class="preview"></section>
    <script>
      const name = "Mustafa";
      const para = document.createElement("p");

      const phonebook = [
        { name: "Chris", number: "1549" },
        { name: "Li Kang", number: "9634" },
        { name: "Anne", number: "9065" },
        { name: "Francesca", number: "3001" },
        { name: "Mustafa", number: "6888" },
        { name: "Tina", number: "4312" },
        { name: "Bert", number: "7780" },
        { name: "Jada", number: "2282" },
      ];

/*       Add your code here
      for (const phone of phonebook){
        if (phone.name === name){
          para.textContent = `found ${phone.name}`
          break;
        }
      } */

      let i = 0;
      console.log(phonebook.length);
      while (i < phonebook.length) {
        if (phonebook[i].name === name) {
          para.textContent = `found ${phonebook[i].name} and no is ${phonebook[i].number}`;
        }
        i++;
      }
      // Don't edit the code below here!
      const section = document.querySelector("section");
      section.appendChild(para);
