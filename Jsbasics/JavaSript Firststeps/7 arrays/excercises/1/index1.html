    <!-- Let's start off with some basic array practice. In this task we'd like you to create an array of three items, stored inside a variable called myArray. The items can be anything you want â€” how about your favorite foods or bands?

Next, modify the first two items in the array using simple bracket notation and assignment. Then add a new item to the beginning of the array.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example: -->
    <script>
      // Add your code here
      const myArray = ["Sova", "Sage", "Omen"];
      myArray[0] = "Cypher";
      myArray[1] = "Raze";
      const myArray2 = ["Viper", "Jett"];
      myArray.push(myArray2);
      // Don't edit the code below here!

      section.innerHTML = " ";
      let para1 = document.createElement("p");
      para1.textContent = `Array: ${myArray}`;

      section.appendChild(para1);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
