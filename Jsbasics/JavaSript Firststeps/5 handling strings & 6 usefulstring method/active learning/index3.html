    <!-- Making new strings from old parts
In this last exercise, the array contains a bunch of strings containing information about train stations in the North of England. The strings are data items that contain the three-letter station code, followed by some machine-readable data, followed by a semicolon, followed by the human-readable station name. For example:

MAN675847583748sjt567654;Manchester Piccadilly
We want to extract the station code and name, and put them together in a string with the following structure:

MAN: Manchester Piccadilly
We'd recommend doing it like this:

Extract the three-letter station code and store it in a new variable.
Find the character index number of the semicolon.
Extract the human-readable station name using the semicolon character index number as a reference point, and store it in a new variable.
Concatenate the two new variables and a string literal to make the final string.
Change the value of the result variable to equal to the final string, not the station. -->
