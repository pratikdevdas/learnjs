    <!-- Filtering greeting messages
In the first exercise we'll start you off simple â€” we have an array of greeting card messages, but we want to sort them to list just the Christmas messages. We want you to fill in a conditional test inside the if( ... ) structure, to test each string and only print it in the list if it is a Christmas message.

Think about how you could test whether the message in each case is a Christmas message. What string is present in all of those messages, and what method could you use to test whether it is present?

    <script>
      const list = document.querySelector(".output ul");
      list.innerHTML = "";
      const greetings = [
        "Happy Birthday!",
        "Merry Christmas my love",
        "A happy Christmas to all the family",
        "You're all I want for Christmas",
        "Get well soon",
      ];

      for (let greeting of greetings) {
        // Your conditional test needs to go inside the parentheses
        // in the line below, replacing what's currently there
        if (greeting.includes("Christmas")) {
          const listItem = document.createElement("li");
          listItem.textContent = greeting;
          list.appendChild(listItem);
        }
      }
    </script>
  </body>
