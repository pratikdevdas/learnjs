    <!-- In this task you are provided with two variables, quote and substring, which contain two strings. We would like you to:

    Retrieve the length of the quote, and store it in a variable called quoteLength.
    Find the index position where substring appears in quote, and store that value in a variable called index.
    Use a combination of the variables you have and available string properties/methods to trim down the original quote to "I do not like green eggs and ham.", and store it in a variable called revisedQuote.
    Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example: -->
    <script>
      const quote =
        "I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.";
      const substring = "green eggs and ham";

      // Add your code here
      const quoteLength = quote.length;
      const index = quote.indexOf(substring);
      const revisedQuote = quote.slice(0, index) + substring;
      // Don't edit the code below here!

      section.innerHTML = " ";
      const para1 = document.createElement("p");
      para1.textContent = `The quote is ${quoteLength} characters long.`;
      const para2 = document.createElement("p");
      para2.textContent = revisedQuote;

      section.appendChild(para1);
      section.appendChild(para2);
    </script>
  </body>
