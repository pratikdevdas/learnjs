    <!-- In the final task for this article, we want you to write some tests. You've got three groups, each consisting of a statement and two variables. For each one, write a test that proves or disproves the statement made. Store the results of those tests in variables called weightComparison, heightComparison, and pwdMatch, respectively. -->
