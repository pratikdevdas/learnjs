    <!-- Let's start out by testing your knowledge of basic math operators. You will have to create four numeric values, then add the first two together, then subtract the fourth from the third, then multiply the two secondary results together to get a result of 48. Finally, we need to write a test that proves that this value is an even number.

So, try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example, following these steps:

Create four variables that contain numbers. Call the variables something sensible.
Add the first two variables together and store the result in another variable.
Subtract the fourth variable from the third and store the result in another variable.
Multiply the results from the last two steps together, storing the result in a variable called finalResult. The product should be 48. If it isn't, you'll have to adjust some of the initial input values.
Finally, write a calculation that checks whether finalResult is an even number. Store the result in a variable called evenOddResult. -->
    <script>
      let finalResult;

      let evenOddResult;

      // Add your code here

      let a = 4,
        b = 8,
        c = 11,
        d = 15;

      let sum = a + b;
      let substract = d - c;

      finalResult = sum * substract;

      evenOddResult = finalResult % 2;

      // Don't edit the code below here!

      section.innerHTML = " ";
      const para1 = document.createElement("p");
      const finalResultCheck =
        finalResult === 48 ? `Yes, well done!` : `No, it is ${finalResult}`;
      para1.textContent = `Is the finalResult 48? ${finalResultCheck}`;
      const para2 = document.createElement("p");
      const evenOddResultCheck =
        evenOddResult === 0
          ? "The final result is even!"
          : "The final result is odd. Hrm.";
      para2.textContent = evenOddResultCheck;

      section.appendChild(para1);
      section.appendChild(para2);
