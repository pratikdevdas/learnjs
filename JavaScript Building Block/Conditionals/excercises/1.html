    <!-- In this task you are provided with two variables:

season — contains a string that says what the current season is.
response — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel.
We want you to create a conditional that checks whether season contains the string "summer", and if so assigns a string to response that gives the user an appropriate message about the season. If not, it should assign a generic string to response that tells the user we don't know what season it is.

To finish off, you should then add another test that checks whether season contains the string "winter", and again assigns an appropriate string to response.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example: -->
    <script>
      let season = "winter";
      let response;

      // Add your code here
      if (season === "summer") {
        response = `${season} season`;
      } else if (season === "winter") {
        response = `${season} season`;
      } else {
        response = `unknown`;
      }

      // Don't edit the code below here!

      section.innerHTML = " ";
      let para1 = document.createElement("p");
      para1.textContent = response;
      section.appendChild(para1);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
